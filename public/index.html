            The main scope of this page is to display some of the pictures made
            by mars rovers. They are being sent to the red planet as a part of
            NASA's Mars Exploration Program (MEP). It was formed in 1993 and
            made use of orbital spacecraft, landers, and Mars rovers to explore
            the possibilities of life on Mars, as well as the planet's climate
            and natural resources. Over the years, NASA has sent five rovers to
            Mars: Sojourner, Spirit and Opportunity, Curiosity, and
            Perseverance. This page collects the data from publicly available
            API available at
            <a href="https://api.nasa.gov/" id="nasa-link">NASA's</a> webpage.
            It provides data from three rovers. You can read a bit more about
            them in a section below:

                    One of two rovers launched in 2003 to explore Mars and
                    search for signs of past life, Spirit far outlasted her
                    planned 90-day mission, lasting over six years. Among her
                    myriad discoveries, Spirit found evidence that Mars was once
                    much wetter than it is today and helped scientists better
                    understand the Martian wind. In May 2009, the rover became
                    embedded in soft soil at a site called "Troy" with only five
                    working wheels to aid in the rescue effort. After months of
                    testing and carefully planned maneuvers, NASA ended efforts
                    to free the rover and eventually ended the mission on May
                    25, 2011.

                    Opportunity was the second of the two rovers launched in
                    2003 to land on Mars and begin traversing the Red Planet in
                    search of signs of ancient water. The rover explored the
                    Martian terrain for almost 15 years, far outlasting her
                    planned 90-day mission. After landing on Mars in 2004,
                    Opportunity made a number of discoveries about the Red
                    Planet including dramatic evidence that long ago at least
                    one area of Mars stayed wet for an extended period and that
                    conditions could have been suitable for sustaining microbial
                    life. The Opportunity rover stopped communicating with Earth
                    when a severe Mars-wide dust storm blanketed its location in
                    June 2018. After more than a thousand commands to restore
                    contact, engineers in the Mission Control at NASA's Jet
                    Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) made their last attempt to
                    revive Opportunity Tuesday, February 13, 2019, to no avail.
                    The solar-powered rover's final communication was received
                    June 10.

                  The Mars Science Laboratory mission and its Curiosity rover
                  mark a transition between the themes of "Follow the Water" and
                  "Seek Signs of Life." In addition to landing in a place with
                  past evidence of water, Curiosity is seeking evidence of
                  organics, the chemical building blocks of life. Places with
                  water and the chemistry needed for life potentially provide
                  habitable conditions. This mission is part of a series of
                  expeditions to the red planet that help meet the four main
                  science goals of the Mars Exploration Program: determine
                  whether life ever arose on mars, characterize the climate and
                  geology of mars and prepare for human exploration.
