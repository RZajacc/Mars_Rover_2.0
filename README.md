# Mars rover photos

### Description

Project is using one of NASA's open API'S. You can find a list of all of the available ones by clicking on a [link](https://api.nasa.gov/). Mars rover API let's you collect image data gathered by three mars rovers (Curiosity, Opportunity and Spirit).

The idea for this project is to display photos provided by the API and organize them in a structured way. User can select which rover data should be displayed on a selected solar day. It is also possible to sort pictures by a selected camera.

Because standard response for each request returns only 25 elements page navigation allows you dynamically fetch new pages.
